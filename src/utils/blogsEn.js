      "How to Appeal a Parking Ticket in Israel – A Short, Practical Guide",
    description:
      "Got a parking ticket? You’re not alone. In Israel’s major cities (Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa, Rishon LeZion and more) hundreds of thousands of tickets are issued every year. Many are borderline: confusing signage, faded markings, payment-app glitches, wrong vehicle details, or duplicate tickets within a short time. Yet most drivers simply pay. Don’t. This guide explains how to appeal a parking ticket in Israel, what to attach, when to file, and the strongest grounds for cancellation. We’ll finish with how FineFix does it for you in minutes—using AI familiar with municipal bylaws to generate a professional appeal letter.",

    description:
      "Hundreds of thousands of parking tickets are issued every year in Israel. Some are justified. Many are cancelled—sometimes due to a technical error, sometimes confusing signage, and sometimes because the driver acted lawfully but the system didn’t recognize it. The problem? Most drivers never hear about these cases; they just pay.In this post we’ll dive into real cancellation patterns reported across municipalities, explain why they were approved, and show how FineFix learns from the field and uses those insights to strengthen your appeals—automatically, without you needing to study regulations or draft letters.For privacy, some examples are adapted and anonymized; the underlying principle remains. Where public/media coverage exists, we reflect it at a high level.",

        ans: "Sometimes—especially if the change occurred close to your date. FineFix compares dates and emphasizes a “transition-period” ground.",

        ans: "It varies, but with ambiguity, official works, or defective markings, there are clear precedents—so it’s worth checking. FineFix handles the process.",
